    <div>Although the fear of flying is a fairly common phobia, there are individuals on the other end of the spectrum who will do everything within their power to get up in the air.
		 While commercial airliners have come far in the past few decades with advanced flying and safety features, <strong>homebuilt</strong> or <strong>"kit"</strong> planes are still 
		 popular for those looking to take to the sky without a proper pilot's license.
	</div><br>
		 
	<div>Typically, these homebuilt aircraft are created from assembly kits, plans, or simply from "scratch". In the United States specifically,
		 these homebuilt aircraft must be done under the intention of education rather than for profit. Additionally, the primary builder of the aircraft 
		 can apply for a repairman's certificate for that airframe, allowing him/her to complete necessary maintencance procedures and repairs themselves.

	<div>Some homebuilt aircraft enthusiasts spend their entires lives researching and designing plans for their own aircraft. One man,
	<a href="https://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/some-homebuilt-airplanes-create-business-one-created-family-180978276" target="_blank">John Dyke</a>,
		 began building planes in the early 1960's. John had a vision for a small aircraft that could seat his family of four while offering better 
		 performance than the typical Cessna airplane. John's ambitious idea led to a homebuilt aircraft that was not only the exact type
		 of plane he wanted, the the type of plane other enthusiasts were looking for as well.
